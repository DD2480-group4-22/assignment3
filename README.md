## Project
Name: Gson \
URL: [https://github.com/DD2480-group4-22/gson](https://github.com/DD2480-group4-22/gson) \
Gson is a library for Java that can be used to convert Java objects into their JSON representation and JSON strings into their Java object equivalent.
## Onboarding experience
Building the project wasn’t difficult. To build the project either Maven or Gradle has to be installed. The group has used Maven before, it is well documented and easy to use, So therefore we decided to use it. All the dependencies for the project is downloaded and the project is built and tested with "mvn clean package". Some of us had a problem where there would be an error when building the project, but it was resolved by using an older version of java. To build the project Maven is necessary. Building and running the test went smoothly and no unexpected errors occurred. First time it took approximately 2 minutes to build and run the test which seems reasonable, running the test after building took approximately 30 seconds. The project is well documented, but the use of maven isn’t perfectly documented, though using maven is very standardized and well documented so it is easy to know what commands to run to work with the project.

Since everything went good for all of us running the project we continued on it.

## Complexity
1. What are your results for ten complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?
## Refactoring
Plan for refactoring complex code:
Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).
Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):
git diff ...
## Coverage
### Tools
Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.
How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?
### Your own coverage tool
Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.
The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:
git diff ...
What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?
### Evaluation
1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?
2. What are the limitations of your own tool?
3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?
## Coverage improvement
Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.
Report of old coverage: [link]
Report of new coverage: [link]
Test cases added:
git diff ...
Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
