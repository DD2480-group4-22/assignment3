## Project
Name: Gson \
URL: [https://github.com/DD2480-group4-22/gson](https://github.com/DD2480-group4-22/gson) \
Gson is a library for Java that can be used to convert Java objects into their JSON representation and JSON strings into their Java object equivalent.
## Onboarding experience
Did it build and run as documented?
    
See the assignment for details; if everything works out of the box,
there is no need to write much here. If the first project(s) you picked
ended up being unsuitable, you can describe the "onboarding experience"
for each project, along with reason(s) why you changed to a different one.
## Complexity
1. What are your results for ten complex functions?
   * Did all methods (tools vs. manual count) get the same result?
   * Are the results clear?
2. Are the functions just complex, or also long?
3. What is the purpose of the functions?
4. Are exceptions taken into account in the given measurements?
5. Is the documentation clear w.r.t. all the possible outcomes?
## Refactoring
Plan for refactoring complex code:
Estimated impact of refactoring (lower CC, but other drawbacks?).
Carried out refactoring (optional, P+):
git diff ...
## Coverage
### Tools
Document your experience in using a "new"/different coverage tool.
How well was the tool documented? Was it possible/easy/difficult to
integrate it with your build environment?
### Your own coverage tool
Show a patch (or link to a branch) that shows the instrumented code to
gather coverage measurements.
The patch is probably too long to be copied here, so please add
the git command that is used to obtain the patch instead:
git diff ...
What kinds of constructs does your tool support, and how accurate is
its output?
### Evaluation
1. How detailed is your coverage measurement?
2. What are the limitations of your own tool?
3. Are the results of your tool consistent with existing coverage tools?
## Coverage improvement
Show the comments that describe the requirements for the coverage.
Report of old coverage: [link]
Report of new coverage: [link]
Test cases added:
git diff ...
Number of test cases added: two per team member (P) or at least four (P+).
## Self-assessment: Way of working
Current state according to the Essence standard: ...
Was the self-assessment unanimous? Any doubts about certain items?
How have you improved so far?
Where is potential for improvement?

According to the Essence standard of way-of-working our team is in the "working well" phase. We have established good communication and praxis of how to do the work that flows naturally. When assigned to task each team member is available to help one another if necessary and work flow is even. We have developed a understanding between each other and in the beginning we were all strangers but with regular communication we now know how we work and our strengths. Continue to work as we currently do with open communication and helping each other is the plan to move forward.
